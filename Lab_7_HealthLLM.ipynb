        "**Health-LLM** is a specialized large language model designed to **predict and analyze health measures** using **wearable sensor data** and **user demographics**. Developed by **MIT Media Lab**, this model enhances traditional LLMs by integrating physiological signals such as **heart rate, sleep patterns, activity levels, and stress indicators** to provide **personalized health assessments and insights**.  \n",
