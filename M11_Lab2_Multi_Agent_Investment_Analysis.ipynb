        "**🎯 Multi-Agent Orchestration:**\n",
        "The `analyze_stock()` function creates a crew where agents can delegate tasks to each other, work in parallel when possible, and coordinate their findings automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "**📊 Real-Time Data Integration:**\n",
        "The `clean_investment_output()` function demonstrates how to enhance AI analysis with live data - it fetches current stock prices, recent trading history, and key metrics from financial APIs, then formats everything into a professional investment report.\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Why This Approach Works:**\n",
        "- **Delegation** ensures the right specialist handles each task\n",
        "- **RAG** incorporates your private documents into the analysis  \n",
        "- **Real-time data** keeps recommendations current and actionable\n",
        "- **Clean formatting** transforms messy AI output into professional reports\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern can be adapted for any domain where you need specialized AI agents working with both private documents and live data sources."
