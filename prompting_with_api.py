# Applied Generative AI
Instructor: Prof. Dehghani
Welcome to the Applied Generative AI course. In this course, we will explore the foundations and applications of Generative AI using tools like OpenAI's API. By the end of this session, you will:

üü¢ Understand how to set up and connect to OpenAI's API.
üåü Learn about the roles (System, Assistant, User) in prompt design.
‚ú® Generate text, images, and vector embeddings programmatically.
üîß Explore fine-tuning to customize AI models for specific tasks.
Let‚Äôs get started with setting up the OpenAI API!
"""

# Install the OpenAI Python SDK
# This library allows us to interact with OpenAI's API for text, images, and embeddings.
!pip install openai==0.28

from google.colab import userdata
import openai

# Retrieve the key from Colab secrets
openai.api_key = userdata.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Confirm the key was loaded (for debugging only; don‚Äôt print your real key in shared notebooks!)
print("Key loaded:", "Yes" if openai.api_key else "No")

"""üéØ Prompt Playground: Understanding Roles
In OpenAI's API, you interact with the model using roles, which define the flow of the conversation:

‚û°Ô∏è System: Sets the behavior and tone of the assistant (e.g., "You are a cheerful assistant.").
‚û°Ô∏è User: Represents the input or question from the user (e.g., "What is AI?").
‚û°Ô∏è Assistant: Automatically generated responses based on the system and user inputs.
üí° Why Roles Matter: Roles help control the assistant's personality and the quality of responses. For example:

A system message like "You are a strict teacher" makes the assistant respond more formally.
A system message like "You are a friendly chatbot" leads to casual responses.
Let‚Äôs see how these roles work in the next cell!

## Example 1: Without Assistant Role

        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])

"""# Example 2: With Assistant Role"""

# Demonstrating roles in OpenAI's API with the assistant role

# Define the conversation including a predefined assistant response
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a math tutor who explains problems step by step."},  # System role sets the behavior
    {"role": "user", "content": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15"},  # User question
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve for x: \n1. Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10\n2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 5"}  # Predefined assistant response
]

# Send the conversation to the API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",  # Use the chosen model
